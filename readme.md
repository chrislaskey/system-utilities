About
================================================================================

A collection of system-utilities written primarily in bash, though there may
be a few in sh, python, or perl.

update-hostname.sh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple shell script for updating the system hostname in Debian based systems.
Helps a lot when deploying virtual machines, especially since I prefer fresh
installs and automated deployment instead of backups and golden images. Testing in
Debian Squeeze (6.0+) and Ubuntu Server (10.04+).
